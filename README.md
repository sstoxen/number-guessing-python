This is a little project for guessing a number from 1-10 (inclusive).  
It is mostly to dust off my Python skills.  
It is originally from a tutorial but had a lot of...let's say "poor programming choices" in terms of logic flow.
I personally do not like break or continue statements. They can cause serious issues with debugging the flow of code and can almost always be very easily replaced.
